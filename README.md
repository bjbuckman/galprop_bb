# GALPROP_BB

This is the modified version of the state-of-the-art cosmic ray propagation code GALPROP. GALPROP was initially made for modeling the Milky Way galaxy, but I have modified it to take new distributions for gas density, magnetic fields, interstellar radiation fields, and source populations.

The code was used for the analysis used in my published paper on the starburst galaxy M82: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.2679B/abstract. 

The code was initially based on r2504 of GALPROP.
